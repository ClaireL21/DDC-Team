# University of Pennsylvania Game Research And Development Environment Game Jam 2022

Welcome, one and all to the first, official UPGRADE Game Jam! We are very pleased to officially declare this event OPEN!

## Description + Specs

From 11 am 10/29 to 10:30 am 10/30, you are now tasked wi.th creating a game from scratch. The goal for this game jam is for enable everyone participating to put everything they've learned over the past couple of weeks in UPGRADE to use. 
It's ok for the game to be rough.
It's ok for the game to be jank.
It's preferable that the game doesn't brick our computers.

It's important to note, however, that this project will be your OWN GROUP's project, not UPGRADE's (more on that in a minute).

Here are the specs for the game:
1. No gore, nudity, or anything you wouldn't want on your resume.
2. All art assets must be made in-house; they can be from pre-existing projects of your own, but they must be created by someone in your team.
3. All 3rd party code must be sourced; if it's from an open source repo, check their license
4. Public domain sound effects are good

Note:
1. Asset Request Channel is still open for this game jam; if an art asset is needed, Edward can freelance that for you, though moreso in a timely fashion than an artistically driven one.

## Submission Details
Each team will create a fork of this initial repository; that fork will be the repo that that team works off of.
